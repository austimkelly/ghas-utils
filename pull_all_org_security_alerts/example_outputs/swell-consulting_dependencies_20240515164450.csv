6,open,go,gopkg.in/src-d/go-git.v4,go.mod,runtime,GHSA-449p-3h89-pw88,CVE-2023-49569,Maliciously crafted Git server replies can lead to path traversal and RCE on go-git clients,"### Impact
A path traversal vulnerability was discovered in go-git versions prior to `v5.11`. This vulnerability allows an attacker to create and amend files across the filesystem. In the worse case scenario, remote code execution could be achieved.

Applications are only affected if they are using the [ChrootOS](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-git/go-billy/v5/osfs#ChrootOS), which is the default when using ""Plain"" versions of Open and Clone funcs (e.g. PlainClone). Applications using [BoundOS](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-git/go-billy/v5/osfs#BoundOS) or in-memory filesystems are not affected by this issue.
This is a `go-git` implementation issue and does not affect the upstream `git` cli.

### Patches
Users running versions of `go-git` from `v4` and above are recommended to upgrade to `v5.11` in order to mitigate this vulnerability.

### Workarounds
In cases where a bump to the latest version of `go-git` is not possible in a timely manner, we recommend limiting its use to only trust-worthy Git servers.

A denial of service (DoS) vulnerability was discovered in go-git versions prior to `v5.11`. This vulnerability allows an attacker to perform denial of service attacks by providing specially crafted responses from a Git server which triggers resource exhaustion in `go-git` clients. 

Applications using only the in-memory filesystem supported by `go-git` are not affected by this vulnerability.
This is a `go-git` implementation issue and does not affect the upstream `git` cli.

### Patches

Log4j versions prior to 2.16.0 are subject to a remote code execution vulnerability via the ldap JNDI parser.
As per [Apache's Log4j security guide](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html): Apache Log4j2 <=2.14.1 JNDI features used in configuration, log messages, and parameters do not protect against attacker controlled LDAP and other JNDI related endpoints. An attacker who can control log messages or log message parameters can execute arbitrary code loaded from LDAP servers when message lookup substitution is enabled. From log4j 2.16.0, this behavior has been disabled by default.

Log4j version 2.15.0 contained an earlier fix for the vulnerability, but that patch did not disable attacker-controlled JNDI lookups in all situations. For more information, see the `Updated advice for version 2.16.0` section of this advisory.

# Impact

Logging untrusted or user controlled data with a vulnerable version of Log4J may result in Remote Code Execution (RCE) against your application. This includes untrusted data included in logged errors such as exception traces, authentication failures, and other unexpected vectors of user controlled input. 

# Affected versions

Any Log4J version prior to v2.15.0 is affected to this specific issue.

The v1 branch of Log4J which is considered End Of Life (EOL) is vulnerable to other RCE vectors so the recommendation is to still update to 2.16.0 where possible.

## Security releases
Additional backports of this fix have been made available in versions 2.3.1, 2.12.2, and 2.12.3

## Affected packages
Only the `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core` package is directly affected by this vulnerability. The `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-api` should be kept at the same version as the `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core` package to ensure compatability if in use.

# Remediation Advice

## Updated advice for version 2.16.0

The Apache Logging Services team provided updated mitigation advice upon the release of version 2.16.0, which [disables JNDI by default and completely removes support for message lookups](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/changes-report.html#a2.16.0).
Even in version 2.15.0, lookups used in layouts to provide specific pieces of context information will still recursively resolve, possibly triggering JNDI lookups. This problem is being tracked as [CVE-2021-45046](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-45046). More information is available on the [GitHub Security Advisory for CVE-2021-45046](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-7rjr-3q55-vv33).

Users who want to avoid attacker-controlled JNDI lookups but cannot upgrade to 2.16.0 must [ensure that no such lookups resolve to attacker-provided data and ensure that the the JndiLookup class is not loaded](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-3221).

Please note that Log4J v1 is End Of Life (EOL) and will not receive patches for this issue. Log4J v1 is also vulnerable to other RCE vectors and we recommend you migrate to Log4J 2.16.0 where possible.

The fix to address [CVE-2021-44228](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228) in Apache Log4j 2.15.0 was incomplete in certain non-default configurations. This could allow attackers with control over Thread Context Map (MDC) input data when the logging configuration uses a non-default Pattern Layout with either a Context Lookup (for example, $${ctx:loginId}) or a Thread Context Map pattern (%X, %mdc, or %MDC) to craft malicious input data using a JNDI Lookup pattern resulting in a remote code execution (RCE) attack. 

## Affected packages
Only the `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core` package is directly affected by this vulnerability. The `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-api` should be kept at the same version as the `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core` package to ensure compatability if in use.

# Mitigation

Log4j 2.16.0 fixes this issue by removing support for message lookup patterns and disabling JNDI functionality by default. This issue can be mitigated in prior releases (< 2.16.0) by removing the JndiLookup class from the classpath (example: zip -q -d log4j-core-*.jar org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/JndiLookup.class).

Log4j 2.15.0 restricts JNDI LDAP lookups to localhost by default. Note that previous mitigations involving configuration such as to set the system property `log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups` to `true` do NOT mitigate this specific vulnerability.",critical,"[{'value': 'GHSA-7rjr-3q55-vv33', 'type': 'GHSA'}, {'value': 'CVE-2021-45046', 'type': 'CVE'}]","[{'url': 'https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-45046'}, {'url': 'https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-jfh8-c2jp-5v3q'}, {'url': 'https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html'}, {'url': 'https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/12/14/4'}, {'url': 'https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-44228'}, {'url': 'http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/12/14/4'}, {'url': 'https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-apache-log4j-qRuKNEbd'}, {'url': 'https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/security-center/advisory/intel-sa-00646.html'}, {'url': 'http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/12/15/3'}, {'url': 'https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-661247.pdf'}, {'url': 'https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-714170.pdf'}, {'url': 'https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/930724'}, {'url': 'https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-5022'}, {'url': 'https://psirt.global.sonicwall.com/vuln-detail/SNWLID-2021-0032'}, {'url': 'https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/alert-cve-2021-44228.html'}, {'url': 'http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/12/18/1'}, {'url': 'https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-397453.pdf'}, {'url': 'https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-479842.pdf'}, {'url': 'https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/EOKPQGV24RRBBI4TBZUDQMM4MEH7MXCY/'}, {'url': 'https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/SIG7FZULMNK2XF6FZRU4VWYDQXNMUGAJ/'}, {'url': 'https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2022.html'}, {'url': 'https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html'}, {'url': 'https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2022.html'}, {'url': 'https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/EOKPQGV24RRBBI4TBZUDQMM4MEH7MXCY/'}, {'url': 'https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/SIG7FZULMNK2XF6FZRU4VWYDQXNMUGAJ/'}, {'url': 'https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202310-16'}, {'url': 'https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-7rjr-3q55-vv33'}]",2021-12-14T18:01:28Z,2023-10-26T15:01:25Z,,"[{'package': {'ecosystem': 'maven', 'name': 'org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core'}, 'severity': 'critical', 'vulnerable_version_range': '>= 2.13.0, < 2.16.0', 'first_patched_version': {'identifier': '2.16.0'}}, {'package': {'ecosystem': 'maven', 'name': 'org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core'}, 'severity': 'critical', 'vulnerable_version_range': '< 2.12.2', 'first_patched_version': {'identifier': '2.12.2'}}]",CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H,9.1,"[{'cwe_id': 'CWE-502', 'name': 'Deserialization of Untrusted Data'}, {'cwe_id': 'CWE-917', 'name': ""Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')""}]",maven,org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core,critical,">= 2.13.0, < 2.16.0",,https://api.github.com/repos/swell-consulting/swiss-cheese/dependabot/alerts/5,https://github.com/swell-consulting/swiss-cheese/security/dependabot/5,2024-03-13T21:03:47Z,2024-03-13T21:03:47Z,,,,,,,748757395,R_kgDOLKEhkw,swiss-cheese,swell-consulting/swiss-cheese,False,swell-consulting,151086419,O_kgDOCQFlUw,https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/151086419?v=4,,https://api.github.com/users/swell-consulting,https://github.com/swell-consulting,https://api.github.com/users/swell-consulting/followers,https://api.github.com/users/swell-consulting/following{/other_user},https://api.github.com/users/swell-consulting/gists{/gist_id},https://api.github.com/users/swell-consulting/starred{/owner}{/repo},https://api.github.com/users/swell-consulting/subscriptions,https://api.github.com/users/swell-consulting/orgs,https://api.github.com/users/swell-consulting/repos,https://api.github.com/users/swell-consulting/events{/privacy},https://api.github.com/users/swell-consulting/received_events,Organization,False,https://github.com/swell-consulting/swiss-cheese,A demo repository of simple OWASP Top 10 type of vulnerabilities in (mostly) Python.

That's why parsing is based on looking for newline characters. Unfortunately, code looking for partial boundary in the buffer is written inefficiently, so if we upload a file that starts with CR or LF and then is followed by megabytes of data without these characters: all of these bytes are appended chunk by chunk into internal bytearray and lookup for boundary is performed on growing buffer.

This allows an attacker to cause a denial of service by sending crafted multipart data to an endpoint that will parse it.

3,open,pip,requests,requirements.txt,runtime,GHSA-j8r2-6x86-q33q,CVE-2023-32681,Unintended leak of Proxy-Authorization header in requests,"### Impact

Since Requests v2.3.0, Requests has been vulnerable to potentially leaking `Proxy-Authorization` headers to destination servers, specifically during redirects to an HTTPS origin. This is a product of how `rebuild_proxies` is used to recompute and [reattach the `Proxy-Authorization` header](https://github.com/psf/requests/blob/f2629e9e3c7ce3c3c8c025bcd8db551101cbc773/requests/sessions.py#L319-L328) to requests when redirected. Note this behavior has _only_ been observed to affect proxied requests when credentials are supplied in the URL user information component (e.g. `https://username:password@proxy:8080`).

**Current vulnerable behavior(s):**

1. HTTP → HTTPS: **leak**
2. HTTPS → HTTP: **no leak**
3. HTTPS → HTTPS: **leak**
4. HTTP → HTTP: **no leak**

For HTTP connections sent through the proxy, the proxy will identify the header in the request itself and remove it prior to forwarding to the destination server. However when sent over HTTPS, the `Proxy-Authorization` header must be sent in the CONNECT request as the proxy has no visibility into further tunneled requests. This results in Requests forwarding the header to the destination server unintentionally, allowing a malicious actor to potentially exfiltrate those credentials.

The reason this currently works for HTTPS connections in Requests is the `Proxy-Authorization` header is also handled by urllib3 with our usage of the ProxyManager in adapters.py with [`proxy_manager_for`](https://github.com/psf/requests/blob/f2629e9e3c7ce3c3c8c025bcd8db551101cbc773/requests/adapters.py#L199-L235). This will compute the required proxy headers in `proxy_headers` and pass them to the Proxy Manager, avoiding attaching them directly to the Request object. This will be our preferred option going forward for default usage.

### Patches
Starting in Requests v2.31.0, Requests will no longer attach this header to redirects with an HTTPS destination. This should have no negative impacts on the default behavior of the library as the proxy credentials are already properly being handled by urllib3's ProxyManager.

For users with custom adapters, this _may_ be potentially breaking if you were already working around this behavior. The previous functionality of `rebuild_proxies` doesn't make sense in any case, so we would encourage any users impacted to migrate any handling of Proxy-Authorization directly into their custom adapter.

### Workarounds
For users who are not able to update Requests immediately, there is one potential workaround.

You may disable redirects by setting `allow_redirects` to `False` on all calls through Requests top-level APIs. Note that if you're currently relying on redirect behaviors, you will need to capture the 3xx response codes and ensure a new request is made to the redirect destination.
```
import requests
r = requests.get('http://github.com/', allow_redirects=False)
```

1,open,pip,Werkzeug,requirements.txt,runtime,GHSA-xg9f-g7g7-2323,CVE-2023-25577,High resource usage when parsing multipart form data with many fields,"Werkzeug's multipart form data parser will parse an unlimited number of parts, including file parts. Parts can be a small amount of bytes, but each requires CPU time to parse and may use more memory as Python data. If a request can be made to an endpoint that accesses `request.data`, `request.form`, `request.files`, or `request.get_data(parse_form_data=False)`, it can cause unexpectedly high resource usage.

This allows an attacker to cause a denial of service by sending crafted multipart data to an endpoint that will parse it. The amount of CPU time required can block worker processes from handling legitimate requests. The amount of RAM required can trigger an out of memory kill of the process. Unlimited file parts can use up memory and file handles. If many concurrent requests are sent continuously, this can exhaust or kill all available workers.",high,"[{'value': 'GHSA-xg9f-g7g7-2323', 'type': 'GHSA'}, {'value': 'CVE-2023-25577', 'type': 'CVE'}]","[{'url': 'https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/security/advisories/GHSA-xg9f-g7g7-2323'}, {'url': 'https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-25577'}, {'url': 'https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/commit/517cac5a804e8c4dc4ed038bb20dacd038e7a9f1'}, {'url': 'https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/releases/tag/2.2.3'}, {'url': 'https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5470'}, {'url': 'https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230818-0003/'}, {'url': 'https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-xg9f-g7g7-2323'}]",2023-02-15T15:36:26Z,2023-08-18T15:47:26Z,,"[{'package': {'ecosystem': 'pip', 'name': 'Werkzeug'}, 'severity': 'high', 'vulnerable_version_range': '< 2.2.3', 'first_patched_version': {'identifier': '2.2.3'}}]",CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H,7.5,"[{'cwe_id': 'CWE-400', 'name': 'Uncontrolled Resource Consumption'}, {'cwe_id': 'CWE-770', 'name': 'Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling'}]",pip,Werkzeug,high,< 2.2.3,,https://api.github.com/repos/swell-consulting/swiss-cheese/dependabot/alerts/1,https://github.com/swell-consulting/swiss-cheese/security/dependabot/1,2024-03-13T21:03:46Z,2024-03-13T21:03:46Z,,,,,,,748757395,R_kgDOLKEhkw,swiss-cheese,swell-consulting/swiss-cheese,False,swell-consulting,151086419,O_kgDOCQFlUw,https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/151086419?v=4,,https://api.github.com/users/swell-consulting,https://github.com/swell-consulting,https://api.github.com/users/swell-consulting/followers,https://api.github.com/users/swell-consulting/following{/other_user},https://api.github.com/users/swell-consulting/gists{/gist_id},https://api.github.com/users/swell-consulting/starred{/owner}{/repo},https://api.github.com/users/swell-consulting/subscriptions,https://api.github.com/users/swell-consulting/orgs,https://api.github.com/users/swell-consulting/repos,https://api.github.com/users/swell-consulting/events{/privacy},https://api.github.com/users/swell-consulting/received_events,Organization,False,https://github.com/swell-consulting/swiss-cheese,A demo repository of simple OWASP Top 10 type of vulnerabilities in (mostly) Python.
